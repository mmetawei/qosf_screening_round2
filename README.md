# qosf_screening_round2
I am committing my attempt to solve Task2.
This How I tackled the problem
Day1: Reading the task and Having no idea how to solve it
Day2: Searching for techniques for error correction, viewing lecture about Code repitition
Day3: Trying to undersand how the error will change the repeated qubit code
Day4: Code Cell1 --> Circuit implementation for a 1 qubit bit_flip error
Day5-8: Doing other tasks
Day9: Code Cell2 --> Circuit implementation for a 1 qubit phase_flip error
Day10-12: Doing other tasks
Day13: Combining Cell 1 and 2 to make one circuit with possible occurence of both error types
